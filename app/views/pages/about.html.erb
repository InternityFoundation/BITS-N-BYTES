          <p style = "font-size: 20px">
            We believe that cities must be made safer and more inclusive for women and everyone. Collectively, we works to enable
            cities to become safer through collection of data through crowdsourcing and other methods. The user rating that forms the core
            assesses different parameters linked to safety and more inclusive public spaces. We were fortunate to have an
            exceptional advisory board that provided us with comments, experience and ideas to make it a success. We also believe that
            git quantification will help in creating more safety. Having a score for an area provides a simple way to measure improvements.
